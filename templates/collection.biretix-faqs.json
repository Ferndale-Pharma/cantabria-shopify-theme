For adolescent or persistent acne-prone skin, we have the BIRETIX Regime for Adolescent or Persistent Acne-Prone Skin which includes: BIRETIX Cleanser, BIRETIX Tri-Active Anti-Blemish Gel and BIRETIX Hydramat.

Using the recommended regime daily helps support clearer-looking skin and more reliable results over time. If your skin becomes dry or sensitive, reduce frequency and support the skin barrier with an appropriate moisturiser such as BIRETIX Isorepair for deeper hydration and recovery.</p>"

Both BIRETIX regimes can be upgraded to the Treat & Protect bundle, which includes HELIOCARE 360° Acnimat SPF50+. Daily SPF helps protect the skin from UV exposure and supports skin health while using targeted blemish products.

Post-acne marks can have different causes (such as redness or pigmentation), and results vary by individual.
