In addition, Cantabria Labs have started to feature the UVA circle logo in any new products, which signifies that the sunscreen offers at least one-third of its SPF rating as UVA protection - a key requirement under EU recommendations. This ensures that you’re getting broad-spectrum coverage against both UVB (which causes burning) and UVA (which contributes to skin aging and long-term damage).
