NEORETIN offers targeted formulations designed to help improve uneven skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. When choosing a product, it is important to consider your skin type and follow usage guidance to support gradual, visible improvements over time.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>NEORETIN products are typically used as part of a consistent skincare routine that includes cleansing, targeted treatment and hydration. Products that support skin renewal are usually applied after cleansing and before moisturising. Following the recommended order and frequency of use helps improve tolerance and supports more even-looking skin. Daily sun protection should also be included to help protect results.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>NEORETIN products are often recommended for evening use, as skin renewal processes naturally occur overnight. Using targeted treatments in the evening can help support skin recovery while reducing the risk of sun sensitivity during the day. Always follow individual product instructions, and apply broad-spectrum sunscreen during the day when using pigmentation-focused skincare.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Results with NEORETIN vary depending on factors such as skin type, pigmentation depth and consistency of use. Some people may notice gradual improvements in skin tone within a few weeks, while more visible changes may take longer. Consistent use as part of a daily routine, alongside sun protection, is key to supporting more even-looking skin over time.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>NEORETIN can often be incorporated into a broader skincare routine, but care should be taken when combining multiple active products. Using too many targeted treatments at once may increase the risk of irritation. Introducing products gradually and supporting the skin barrier with appropriate hydration can help improve tolerance. Professional advice may be helpful when layering treatments.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>NEORETIN helps support skin renewal and improve uneven tone, reducing the appearance of pigmentation over time. However, pigmentation can return if triggers such as sun exposure are not managed. Using appropriate skincare alongside daily broad-spectrum sun protection is essential for maintaining results. Sunscreens such as HELIOCARE 360° Pigment Solution Fluid SPF50+ help protect against UVA, UVB, visible light and infrared-A, supporting a more even complexion long term.</p>"
